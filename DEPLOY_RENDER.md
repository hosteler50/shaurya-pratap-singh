Render.com Deployment Guide — Hostel Review Website

Overview
This guide walks you through deploying the Hostel Review Website to Render.com (FREE tier) with a SQLite database.

Prerequisites
- GitHub account (to push the code)
- Render.com account (free; sign up at https://render.com)
- Your project locally working (SQLite migration completed)

Step 1: Prepare Code for GitHub
1. Open PowerShell in your project folder:
   ```powershell
   cd "c:\Users\harsh\OneDrive\Desktop\hostel review website"
   ```

2. Initialize Git repo and commit:
   ```powershell
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Flask app with SQLite"
   ```

3. Create a GitHub repo (at https://github.com/new) named `hostel-review-app`

4. Push to GitHub:
   ```powershell
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hostel-review-app.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

Step 2: Deploy to Render.com
1. Go to https://render.com/dashboard
2. Click "New +" → "Web Service"
3. Select "Deploy from a Git repository"
4. Click "Connect GitHub" and authorize
5. Search for and select `hostel-review-app` repo
6. Fill in:
   - **Name**: `hostel-review-app`
   - **Environment**: `Python 3`
   - **Build Command**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - **Start Command**: `gunicorn app:app`
   - **Plan**: Free (or Starter)
7. Under "Environment Variables":
   - Add `FLASK_ENV` = `production`
   - Add `SECRET_KEY` = copy a long random string (e.g., generated by `python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"`)
8. Click "Create Web Service"

Step 3: Wait for deployment (2–5 minutes)
- Render will build and start your app
- You'll see a live URL like `hostel-review-app-xyz.onrender.com`
- Check logs for any errors

Step 4: Test the live site
- Visit your Render URL
- Sign up / Log in
- Add a hostel and review

Troubleshooting

Issue: "Import error: models.py"
- Ensure `models.py` is in the repo root (same level as `app.py`)
- Push the latest code to GitHub: `git add . && git commit -m "Fix" && git push`
- Redeploy: go to Render dashboard, find the service, click "Manual Deploy"

Issue: Database migrations failed
- The SQLite database is created on first app start
- Check Render logs (Logs tab in service) for error details
- If needed, delete and redeploy

Issue: Images not uploading
- On Render's free tier, `/tmp` is ephemeral (deleted on redeploy)
- Long-term: use a cloud storage service (AWS S3, Cloudinary) instead of local uploads
- For now: images will be lost on redeploy, but that's OK for testing

Issue: "Secret key missing"
- Ensure you set `SECRET_KEY` env var in Render dashboard
- Redeploy after setting it

Optional: Add Custom Domain
- In Render dashboard, go to Settings → Custom Domains
- Add your domain (e.g., `myhostelreview.com`)
- Point your domain registrar's DNS to Render's servers (instructions provided)

Database
- SQLite database (`hostels.db`) is stored locally in the `/data` folder on Render
- On redeploy, the database is preserved (Render uses persistent storage for SQLite)
- No migration to PostgreSQL needed unless you plan to scale or use multiple Render instances

That's it! Your site is now live on Render for free.
